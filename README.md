# Travel-and-Accommodation-Booking-Platform Project (Work in Progress)

## Overview

Welcome to the GIMC project! This repository is a work in progress, actively under development by our team. The ultimate goal of GIMC is to provide a comprehensive, scalable, and secure platform for managing various entities (e.g., cities, hotels, rooms) in a travel and accommodation booking environment. By leveraging a clean architecture, CQRS with MediatR, and robust JWT authentication, GIMC aims to deliver a seamless and maintainable solution for handling complex business logic.
